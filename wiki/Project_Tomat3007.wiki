#summary Project Tomat3007 - Arduino Ethernet with 433Mhz (Sender+Receiver)

Hi, here is my Project:

I would like to control all my power sockets and room lights over website with 
 * a normal PC
 * a smartphone
 * something that can display websites

Important:

All must be

 * low cost
 * full removeable (if you change your flat or house)
 * plug and play (useable for normal users - without skills in developing or hardware) 
 * configurable over website (new devices / build groups of devices / build cronjobs to switch On/Off devices)

===Current situation:===
 * All Components are connected (with the jumper wires)
 * the Network-Interface is ready ~~to get a DHCP-IP and present a static html-site. (For that I use the Ethercard Lib - [https://github.com/jcw/ethercard Link])~~ and has a static IP.
 * ~~3 power sockets are static included and can be switched On/Off over Website (One by One or all together over an GroupSwitchOn)~~
 * Devices can be add over the Website by an normal User.
 * The Device can turn on/off over Website OR Remote. If the User use the Remote, the arduino know that and change the status from this device to ON/OFF for Website presentation.
 * all Data (htm-Files, js-Files, Pictures) are saved on an microSD.
 * all Systemdata (which device is on or off, which code is for on or for off) are saved on the microSD, too.

=====NEW (2012-04-02):=====
 * User can change the Static IP over Website
 * a Picture of the FLAT can be include over MicroSD. Than the User can add a Device an save the position on the Picture.
 * User can delete a Device
 * There are two Display View's. One for Mobile Devices without Picture and one for static PC with a Picture of the FLAT.

You can see a video below...


===Components:===
 * 433 Mhz Receiver ([http://www.watterott.com/de/RF-Link-2400bps-Empfaenger-434MHz Link])
 * 433 Mhz Sender ([http://www.watterott.com/de/RF-Link-Sender-434MHz Link])
