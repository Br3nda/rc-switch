#summary How to send codes to a device.

If you intend to only operate some power sockets you should take a look at [http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/wiki/HowTo_OperateLowCostOutlets this HowTo].

----

There are three methods to send raw codes:

* send(string binaryCode) *

Sends the binary string.



* send(int decimalCode, int bitLength) *

Same as the first one but using the decimal value. The bit length is needed to zero-fill the binary code.



* sendTriState(string triStateCode) *
Tri-state codes are according to the data sheets of some encoding chips. Take a look at [http://sui77.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/163/ this blogpost] if you are interested in details.
