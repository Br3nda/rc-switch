#summary Some example sketches and explanation about which method to use.

= What kind of switch =

There are generally two kinds of outlet switches. The first one is configured with a 10 pole DIP switch the other one is configured with two rotary (or sliding) switches with four setting possibilities each.

= Type A: 10 pole DIP switches =

RCSwitch::switchOn("11001", 2);

The first parameter represents the setting of the first 5 DIP switches. In this example it's ON-ON-OFF-OFF-ON.

The second parameter represents the setting of the last 5 DIP switches. As only one of these must be ON, it's the number of the DIP switch which is ON. In this example the last 5 DIP switches are OFF-ON-OFF-OFF-OFF.


= Two rotary/sliding switches =

RCSwitch::switchOn(4, 2);

The first parameter represents the setting of the first rotary switch. In this example it's switched to "4" or "D" or "IV".

The second parameter represents the setting of the second rotary switch. In this example it's switched to "2" or "B" or "II".
