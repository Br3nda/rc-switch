#summary How to receive codes from a remote control

= Quick Start =

 * Connect a receiver to Pin #2 of your Arduino.
 * Upload the ReceiveDemo sketch which is provided in the libary. 
 * Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
 * Press any key on your remote

(You can also use any other external interrupt pin of your Arduino instead of interrupt #0/Pin #2)

= How it works =

With the enableReceive method the Arduino will listen to incoming signals on the external interrupt (first parameter). Note that most boards have only two external interrupts: number 0 (on digital pin 2) and 1 (on digital pin 3) ([http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt The Arduino Mega has some more]). When a code was detected a callback method will be called (second parameter).

The callback method takes 4 parameters: 
 * decimal value of the code
 * bit length (might be needed as the values can be zero-filled)
 * delay (this is the time it takes to send 1/4 bit or 1/31 of the synchronization low level)
 * raw array of microseconds between HIGH and LOW states

= Example =

{{{
#include <RCSwitch.h>

RCSwitch mySwitch = RCSwitch();

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(9600);
  mySwitch.enableReceive(0, output);

}

void loop() {

}

void output(unsigned long decimal, unsigned int length, unsigned int delay, unsigned int* raw) {

  if (decimal == 0) {
    Serial.print("Unknown encoding.");
  } else {
    char* b = dec2binWzerofill(decimal, length);
    Serial.print("Decimal: ");
    Serial.print(decimal);
    Serial.print(" (");
    Serial.print( length );
    Serial.print("Bit) ");
    Serial.print(" PulseLength: ");
    Serial.print(delay);
    Serial.println(" microseconds");
  }
  
  Serial.print("Raw data: ");
  for (int i=0; i<= length*2; i++) {
    Serial.print(raw[i]);
    Serial.print(",");
  }
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println();

}
