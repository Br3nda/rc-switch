#summary How to receive codes from a remote control

= Quick Start =

 * Connect a receiver to Pin #2 of your Arduino.
 * Upload the ReceiveDemo sketch which is provided in the libary. 
 * Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
 * Press any key on your remote

(You can also use any other external interrupt pin of your Arduino instead of interrupt #0/Pin #2)

= How it works =

With the enableReceive method the Arduino will listen to incoming signals on the external interrupt (first parameter). Note that most boards have only two external interrupts: number 0 (on digital pin 2) and 1 (on digital pin 3) ([http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt The Arduino Mega has some more]).

Please take a look at the ReceiveDemo examples which are delivered with the library.
