#summary How to receive codes from a remote control

= Quick Start =

 * Connect a receiver to Pin #2 of your Arduino.
 * Upload the ReceiveDemo sketch which is provided in the libary. 
 * Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
 * Press any key on your remote

= How it works =

With the enableReceive method the Arduino will listen to incoming signals on the external interrupt (first parameter). Note that most boards have only two external interrupts: number 0 (on digital pin 2) and 1 (on digital pin 3) ([http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt The Arduino Mega has some more]). When a code was detected a callback method will be called (second parameter).

The callback method takes 4 parameters: 
 * decimal value of the code
 * bit length (might be needed as the values can be zero-filled)
 * delay (this is the time it takes to send 1/4 bit)
 * raw array of microseconds between HIGH and LOW states
